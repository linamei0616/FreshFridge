### Our Story
In America, 108 million pounds of food is wasted every year which equates to 40% of the US Food Supply.
As a team of college students, we wanted to create an app that combats food waste and help new college students transition from living with their parents to adulthood.

### Features
1) Allows individual user to input data about the groceries in their fridge
2) Alerts users when their groceries are about to expire
3) A future feature includes the calculation of food in pounds saved

## Repo Structure
All the files can be viewed at [`/FreshFridge`](https://github.com/linamei0616/FreshFridge/tree/main/FreshFridge/FreshFridge)

The heart of our app is located at [`/ContentView.swift`](https://github.com/linamei0616/FreshFridge/blob/main/FreshFridge/FreshFridge/Views/ContentView.swift)
